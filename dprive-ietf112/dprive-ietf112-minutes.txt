### Current Working Group Business

    - Chairs Action:

Paul Hoffman:  04 version out, little comments. Authenicated fell off.

Joey: advancing work on a specific use case should not limit the advance of other use cases; we're all working on  having better encryption of the net and it should'nt be  "either or ".

ekr: interested in use case is still constant. WG interest has fallen off.
Waiting to hear interest in Ben's document.

Brian Haberman: WGLC to see if folks are happy, mark it for experimentation.

PH: Don't want dictorate reviews as this is still in flux.

ekr: no progress for consensus on this approach.

*Action Item: Chairs will huddle with AD on use case discussion*

### New Working Group Business

*   draft-dkgjsal-dprive-unilateral-probing
    - https://gitlab.com/dkg/dprive-unilateral-probing/-/blob/main/unilateral-probing.md
    - joeygsal@gmail.com 20min
    - Chairs Action:

dkg: Not in datatracker, but will upload shortly.

Ben Schwartz: Supports adoption, also when Paul Hoffman wrote initially.

Brian Dickson: Proposed is How, left unanswered is the When.

dkg: wants to get as many queries as possible

BD: vendor of long tail of domains would have issues supporting

Joey:  we could add in the auth servers recommendations section.

dkg: section on resource exhaustion under server guidance, should add stop answering on
encrypter connections.

ekr: would love to hear from auth servers to something which leads to universal encryption.

Peter van Dijk:  DNS Error Reporting draft, though could have troubles. SNI might make sense in
some scenarios.  Return TCP Reset, was told too expensive.

Erik Nygren: availability/stability important in their authorative platform.  Maybe discuss how not to do this.

dkg: don't want to overburden providers who do not wish to roll this out. auth / recursive may be different
(fill in)

BS: Aware in real interest in 100% encryption. unilateral probing makes STS signal unneccesary.

dkg: one non strict signal is wanting error reports

BD: want to provide encryption transport.

dkg: shame if greedy clients cause this to fail

BD: do want to use SNI to handle subset of names

dkg: designed to fall back to cleartext

*   draft-schwartz-ds-glue
    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-schwartz-ds-glue/
    - bemasc@google.com 20min
    - Chairs Action:

Warren Kumari: Likes authenicated, feels complex. potential reasonable. Requires DNSSEC, but folks can not 
add DS records easily. Better than nothing. 

BS: can also CDNSKEY, but only if child can get convince parent. 

Jonathan Reed:  Can we add random DS record types. Also we have Flag Day ideas. Can we ever add new RRTypes?

ekr: would implore the chairs to craft a mechanism to solve this problem. 

PH: what ekr said

dkg: Likes draft/framing. Have you tried to publish such records

BS: there are barriers to this. limited number of CDS implementations

dkr: we need new signed record types 

Peter Thomassen: child zone name is leaked. 

BS: NS name is not sensitive. 

Ralf Weber: Can change stuff at parent. More in line with how DNS works. 

BS: work involved in adding new record types to parent

Robert Evans:  Multiple Paths ADoT adoption. Perhaps lower bar to "could work"

BS: Experimental solution in charter. 

*Action Item: follow up on ekr's mechanism crafting comment*
